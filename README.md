## ‚ú® Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a strong and practical understanding of Java from the ground up. Each concept is isolated in its own package to ensure that the code is easy to navigate, understand, and test. This repository covers everything from basic syntax and data types to the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## üìö Topics Covered

The practice code is organized into the following topic-based packages located in the `src` directory. The list below accurately reflects the folder structure of the repository.

| Topic                    | Folder Name              | Description                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Arrays**               | `arrays`                 | Practice with single and multi-dimensional arrays, iteration, and manipulation.    |
| **Classes & Objects**    | `classesAndObjects`      | Fundamentals of OOP, including class definitions and object instantiation.       |
| **Collections Framework**| `collections`            | Examples using `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, and other common collection types.          |
| **Constructors**         | `constructors`           | Understanding default, parameterized, and overloaded constructors.               |
| **Data Types & Variables** | `dataTypesAndVariables`  | Practice with Java's primitive and reference data types and variable declaration. |
| **Encapsulation**        | `encapsulation`          | Implementing data hiding using `private` fields and public getters/setters.      |
| **Exception Handling**   | `exceptionHandling`      | Using `try-catch-finally` blocks to manage runtime errors gracefully.          |
| **Inheritance**          | `inheritance`            | Examples of creating subclass/superclass relationships (`extends`).              |
| **Input & Output (I/O)**  | `inputAndOutput`         | Reading user input from the console (`Scanner`) and printing output.             |
| **Loops**                | `loops`                  | Practice with `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops for controlled iteration.     |
| **Methods**              | `methods`                | Defining and invoking methods, understanding parameters, and return types.         |
| **Operators**            | `operators`              | Using arithmetic, relational, logical, and other Java operators.               |
| **Polymorphism**         | `polymorphism`           | Demonstrating method overriding and dynamic method dispatch.                     |
| **Statements**           | `statements`             | Using conditional statements like `if-else`, `else-if`, and `switch`.          |
| **Strings**              | `strings`                | Working with the `String` class and its various utility methods.                 |

## üöÄ Getting Started

You can clone this repository to run and experiment with the code examples on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Make sure you have a recent version of the JDK installed. You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

### How to Compile and Run a File

1.  **Clone the repository to your local machine:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/itsrafay03/java-topics-practice.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the source directory from your terminal:**
    ```bash
    cd java-topics-practice/src
    ```

3.  **Compile a specific Java file.** For example, to compile a file from the `loops` directory:
    ```bash
    javac loops/ForLoopExample.java
    ```
    This will create a `.class` file (`ForLoopExample.class`) inside the `loops` folder.

4.  **Run the compiled program.** When running, you must use the fully qualified name (package name + class name) from the `src` directory:
    ```bash
    java loops.ForLoopExample
    ```
