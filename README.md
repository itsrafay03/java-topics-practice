## 📌 About the Project

This repository serves as a practical "playground" for mastering core Java concepts. Each topic is isolated in its own package with focused, minimal code to demonstrate principles effectively.

### Objectives

- 🔁 Reinforce Java fundamentals through practical exercises
- 🔍 Provide a clean reference for key topics
- 🧼 Promote clean coding and standard conventions
- 📈 Track and showcase your Java learning journey

---

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ **Modular Design**: Each concept is placed in its own package for clear separation.
- 🧪 **Focused Examples**: Code examples directly illustrate the target concept without unnecessary complexity.
- 📘 **Comprehensive Coverage**: From variables and conditionals to OOP and exception handling.
- 💻 **Easy to Run**: Standalone `.java` files with `main` methods for instant execution.
