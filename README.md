## üéØ About This Project
The primary goal of this repository is to serve as a practical "workbook" for Java programming. By isolating each core concept into its own dedicated package, it provides a structured and organized way to learn and review.

The main objectives are:
*   **Reinforce Fundamentals:** Solidify understanding through focused, practical code.
*   **Serve as a Quick Reference:** Easily find and review specific Java concepts without unnecessary complexity.
*   **Demonstrate Clean Code Practices:** Each example aims for clarity and follows standard Java conventions.
*   **Track Learning Progress:** Acts as a living document of skills acquired in core Java.

## ‚ú® Key Features
*   **Modular Structure:** Each topic is encapsulated in its own package for maximum clarity.
*   **Focused Examples:** The code is simple and directly demonstrates the concept at hand, avoiding boilerplate.
*   **Comprehensive Coverage:** Spans from the most basic data types to the foundational pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
*   **Ready to Run:** Each example is self-contained and can be compiled and run with a standard JDK.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
*   **Language:** **Java**
*   **Build/Run:** **JDK (Java Development Kit)**

## üìÅ Repository Structure & Topics
The repository is organized logically, with all source code residing in the `src` directory. Each subfolder corresponds to a specific Java concept.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have a JDK (version 8 or newer) installed. You can download it from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use an open-source distribution like [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/).

### Installation & Execution

1.  **Clone the repository to your local machine:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/itsrafay03/java-topics-practice.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the source directory using your terminal:**
    ```bash
    cd java-topics-practice/src
    ```

3.  **Compile a Java file.** The `javac` command compiles your `.java` source file into `.class` bytecode.
    *Example with a file from the `loops` package:*
    ```bash
    # This command must be run from the 'src' directory
    javac loops/ForLoopExample.java
    ```

4.  **Run the compiled program.** The `java` command executes the bytecode. You must use the fully qualified class name (e.g., `packageName.ClassName`).
    *Example:*
    ```bash
    # This command must also be run from the 'src' directory
    java loops.ForLoopExample
    ```
